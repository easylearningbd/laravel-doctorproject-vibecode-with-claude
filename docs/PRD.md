PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
Doccure
Doctor Appointment Booking SaaS — Laravel 13 + Claude

1. Product Summary
Product Name
Doccure
One-Line Description
A web platform where patients can find doctors, book appointments with time slots, and pay online — while doctors manage their schedule and admins oversee the entire system.
Core Value Proposition
Reduces the friction of finding a doctor and booking an appointment from days (phone calls, waiting rooms) down to two minutes (search → pick slot → pay).
Target Market
Small-to-medium independent clinics, solo practitioners, and patients in regions where in-person doctor booking is still a slow, manual process.
2. User Roles
Doccure has three distinct user roles. Each role has a separate dashboard, separate permissions, and a separate user journey.
2.1 Admin
•	Manages all doctors, patients, appointments, and specialities
•	Views platform revenue, user growth, and analytics dashboards
•	Manages reviews, transactions, and global site settings
•	Has full visibility into the entire platform
2.2 Doctor
•	Manages own profile (bio, experience, education, fees, availability)
•	Accepts or rejects appointment requests
•	Views patient list and appointment history
•	Manages clinic locations and weekly availability timings
•	Views earnings and payout dashboard
2.3 Patient
•	Searches doctors by speciality, location, and availability
•	Views doctor profile, ratings, and reviews
•	Books appointments by selecting a date and time slot
•	Pays online via Stripe
•	Views upcoming and past appointments
•	Manages own profile and basic medical information

7. System Architecture
High-Level Flow
Browser (Admin / Doctor / Patient) → Laravel Backend (Controllers → Services → Models) → MySQL Database
External services: Stripe (payments), Mail Service (notifications), S3 (file storage in production)
Folder Structure
•	Controllers: app/Http/Controllers/{Admin, Doctor, Patient, Public}
•	Services: app/Services/{Domain} — all business logic lives here
•	Form Requests: app/Http/Requests/{Admin, Doctor, Patient}
•	Views: resources/views/{admin, doctor, patient, public}
•	Tests: tests/Feature and tests/Unit (Pest)
Request Lifecycle Example
A patient clicks 'Book Appointment'. The request flows: Browser → Route → Controller → AppointmentService → Database → Stripe Webhook → Mail Queue → Response back to browser.
Each layer has a single responsibility. Controllers handle HTTP. Services handle logic. Models handle data.
8. Security Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
•	Every user input must pass through a Form Request validation class
•	Every Eloquent query must use parameter binding — no raw queries
•	Every route must be protected by the appropriate role middleware
•	Every sensitive action must use a Laravel Policy for authorization
•	Passwords, tokens, and PII must NEVER be logged
•	.env files and API keys must NEVER be committed to Git
•	All payment-related code must be reviewed by the security subagent before merge
•	Rate limiting must be applied on login, booking, and webhook endpoints
•	HTTPS must be enforced in production (no HTTP fallback)
9. Project Constraints
•	Scope: MVP only. No Phase 2 features built during this course.
•	Timeline: Designed to be built in approximately 8 weeks of part-time work.
•	Budget: Open-source-first. Only paid services are Stripe (transaction fee), email provider, and hosting.
•	Team: Solo developer using Claude as the AI pair programmer.
•	Quality bar: Production-ready. Security subagent reviews mandatory.
10. Out of Scope (See Phase 2 Document)
These features are explicitly NOT built in MVP. Each is documented separately in the Phase 2 document.
•	Pharmacy module
•	Blog module
•	In-app video calls (use external Zoom link as workaround)
•	Live chat / real-time messaging
•	Medical records upload (PDFs, scans)
•	Dependants management (booking for family members)
•	Patient wallet system
•	Multi-language support
•	Mobile application (native iOS / Android)
•	Advanced analytics and reporting
•	Insurance integration
•	Prescriptions and e-pharmacy
11. Document Control
This PRD is a living document. When changes are made, version it.
•	Owner: Project Lead (Ariyan / Kazi Ariyan)
•	Version: 1.0
•	Status: Approved for development
•	Companion documents: MVP_FEATURES.md, CLAUDE.md, PHASE_2_FEATURES.md
